- I was thinking "should i restrict this to stocks only or also include commodities?" cuz i gotta
account for negative prices like that time in 2020 when oil went negative. For this, is it better to use a 
one bit attrivute for price negtativeness or just use int32? i dont want to massively cut down on my price range
by using 2s complement just for the rare chance of negative prices (which rarely happen anyway). on the other hand, 
int32 still has a very good range for prices. eh, ill just go with int32 and change it later if i have price issues
